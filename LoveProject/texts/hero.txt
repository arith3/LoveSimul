I'm an ordinary software student. Today, as usual, i'm sitting on the bench after the lecture.
What am I doing here... I don't want to study...
while I was thinking pathetic idea, I felt somebody's presence to the right side. 
I turn my head - I checked a girl.
She was very pretty girl. She was staring at her notebook with serious face.
'...java?'
She was solving java questions. The contents seemed to be a very basic content. I thought, she was learning java introductory course.
for a long time, she was concentrating and looking at only one problem without any movement. 
I thought it's a difficult problem for her.
'....help her?'
I studied java last year. My grade... oh, I don't want to remind that. Then java class's professor name is Tee... stop it.
Well, looking at her troubles, I wanted to help her
"...Can I help you?"
#
"Oh, I am a student at Ajou University Software Department. I think I can help you."
She made a puzzled expression for a moment, but immediately understood the situation and smiled.
#
"! Yeah! Okay."
All right, I tell her that I help you, so I will help her perfectly!
"Then.. let's solve the first problem."
